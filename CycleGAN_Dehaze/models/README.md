## Model Files
As we strive to enhance our project's accessibility and usability, we've encountered a small hurdle regarding the size limitations on GitHub repositories.

Regrettably, we are unable to directly upload the saved models due to their larger sizes. However, fret not! We've made provisions to ensure seamless access to these essential components.

You can conveniently download the required model files from our Google Drive repository using the links provided below:

We understand that this additional step may be inconvenient, but we believe it's a small price to pay for the quality and integrity of our project.
