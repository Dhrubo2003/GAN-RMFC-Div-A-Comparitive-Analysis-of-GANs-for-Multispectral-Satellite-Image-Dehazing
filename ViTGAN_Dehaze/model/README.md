## Model Files
As we strive to enhance our project's accessibility and usability, we've encountered a small hurdle regarding the size limitations on GitHub repositories.

Regrettably, due to kernel failures preventing the saving of models on Kaggle, we are unable to directly fetch and upload the saved ViTGAN models. However, fret not! We've made provisions to ensure seamless access to these essential components.

We understand that this additional step may be inconvenient, but we believe it's a small price to pay for the quality and integrity of our project.
